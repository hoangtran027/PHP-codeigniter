      It allows developers to build web applications faster by providing complete libraries for common tasks.
2. Begin Project
A couple of beginner projects here, listed from easiest to hardest :)
- `Model`: has the task of manipulating the database, that is, it will contain all the functions and methods that directly query the data and the controller will pass those functions and methods to get the data and then send it through the View.
- `Controller`: is responsible for receiving data from the controller and displaying the content to HTML code, you can understand roughly this is also known as an interface component.
- `View`: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It is responsible for receiving requests from the client, then processing the request, loading the corresponding model and sending data through the corresponding view and returning the results to the client.
- NOTE: `Use model MVC in project` make more usefull
